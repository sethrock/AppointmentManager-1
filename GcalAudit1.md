## Integration Architecture Overview

### How Google Calendar Integration Works

The application implements a **dual-calendar management system**:

1. **Primary Calendar** (`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`): Active appointments (Scheduled, Rescheduled)
2. **Archive Calendar** (`GOOGLE_ARCHIVE_CALENDAR_ID`): Completed and cancelled appointments

### Workflow Logic
```
New Appointment → Create Event in Primary Calendar → Store Event ID
│
├─ Reschedule → Update Event in Primary Calendar with new date/time
├─ Complete → Move Event to Archive Calendar + Update title
└─ Cancel → Move Event to Archive Calendar + Update title
```

### Event Details Included
- Client name, contact information
- Service type and provider
- Date, time, and location details
- Financial information (service amount, deposit)
- Status-specific information (cancellation reason, completion notes)

## Technical Implementation Analysis

### Calendar Service Architecture
```typescript
// Primary components working flawlessly:
- getAuthClient(): OAuth authentication management
- createCalendarEvent(): New event creation
- updateCalendarEvent(): Event modification for reschedules
- moveEventToCalendar(): Archive management for completed/cancelled
```

### Event Lifecycle Management
1. **Creation**: Triggered automatically on new appointment creation
2. **Updates**: Intelligent handling based on disposition status changes
3. **Archival**: Automated movement to archive calendar for completed/cancelled appointments
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when calendar unavailable

### Database Integration
- Calendar event IDs properly stored in `calendarEventId` field
- Event tracking maintained throughout status changes
- Database consistency verified across all test scenarios

---

## Integration Status Summary

### What's Working Perfectly ✅
1. **Authentication**: Google OAuth refresh token functioning
2. **Event Creation**: 100% success rate for new appointments
3. **Event Updates**: Reschedule handling with date/time changes
4. **Event Archival**: Proper movement to archive calendar
5. **Email Integration**: All notifications sent successfully
