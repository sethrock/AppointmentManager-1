# Data Visualization & Reports Feature Plan

## Current Data Analysis

### Database Schema Overview
Your appointment scheduling platform currently tracks comprehensive data across three main entities:

**Users & Providers:**
- User authentication and management
- Provider management with active/inactive status

**Appointments (Primary Data Source):**
- **Scheduling**: Start/end dates, times, duration, call type (in-call vs out-call)
- **Client Information**: Name, phone, email preferences, location details
- **Financial Tracking**: Projected revenue, travel/hosting expenses, deposits, payment processing, total collected amounts
- **Marketing**: Marketing channel attribution (Eros, Private Delights)
- **Status Management**: Disposition status (Scheduled, Complete, Cancel, Reschedule)
- **Notes & Details**: Client notes, appointment notes, cancellation details

### Current Data Insights (Based on Actual Data)
- **33 total appointments** with $91,349.98 projected revenue
- **27% completion rate** (9 completed out of 33)
- **15% cancellation rate** (5 cancelled)
- **Average revenue per appointment**: $2,768
- **Out-calls generate 67% higher revenue** than in-calls ($3,154 vs $1,880)
- **Eros channel** drives 79% of appointments with higher average revenue
- **Average call duration**: 2.33 hours

## Recommended Additional Data Points

### High-Priority Missing Data

4. **Financial Accuracy**
   - `payment_status` (pending, paid, refunded)
   - `actual_vs_projected_variance` calculation
   - `tip_amount` separate from base revenue

5. **Marketing Attribution**
