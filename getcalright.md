## Analysis

The issue is in the `moveEventToCalendar` function. When an appointment is marked as Complete or Cancelled:
1. The system correctly determines it should move to the archive calendar
2. The event is copied to the new calendar BUT the title (summary) is not updated
3. The original event (with the old emoji) is just copied as-is

## Key Findings

1. The emoji logic exists in both create and update functions
2. The notification flow is correct: Routes → Storage → Notification Service → Calendar Service
3. **CRITICAL BUG**: The `moveEventToCalendar` function doesn't update the event details when moving
4. When status changes to Complete/Cancel, the system moves the event but doesn't update its title

## Root Cause

In `handleAppointmentUpdated`, when the calendars are different:
- It calls `moveEventToCalendar` which just copies the event
- It never calls `updateCalendarEvent` which would update the emoji

## Recommendations

1. Fix the `handleAppointmentUpdated` function to update the event BEFORE moving it
2. Or modify `moveEventToCalendar` to accept updated event data
3. Ensure the emoji is updated regardless of whether the event is moved or not
