# Clients Module Development Plan

## Overview
The clients module will transform how client data is managed by creating a centralized client management system. Currently, client information is duplicated across appointments, which leads to data inconsistency and missed opportunities for client relationship management.

## Core Features

### 1. Client Search & Lookup
- **Global Search Bar**: Search clients by name, email, phone number, or notes
- **Advanced Filters**: 
  - Last appointment date range
  - Total revenue range
  - Marketing channel
  - Provider preference
  - Client status (active, inactive, VIP)
- **Search Results**: Display as cards or table view with key metrics
- **Quick Actions**: Direct actions from search results (call, email, book appointment)

### 2. Client Database & Profile Management
- **Unified Client Records**: Single source of truth for client information
- **Profile Components**:
  - Basic Information (name, phone, email, address)
  - Communication preferences
  - Marketing source & acquisition date
  - Tags and custom labels
  - Internal notes (private)
  - Photo/avatar support
- **Automatic Deduplication**: Merge duplicate client records based on email/phone

### 3. Client History & Timeline
- **Appointment History**: Complete chronological view of all appointments
- **Financial Summary**: 
  - Total revenue generated
  - Average appointment value
  - Payment method preferences
  - Outstanding balances
- **Interaction Timeline**: Track all touchpoints including appointments, cancellations, and notes
- **Communication Log**: Record calls, texts, emails with timestamps

### 4. Client Analytics & Insights
- **Individual Metrics**:
  - Lifetime value (LTV)
  - Appointment frequency
  - Cancellation rate
  - Preferred providers
  - Preferred days/times
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Identify booking patterns and preferences
- **Risk Indicators**: Flag clients with high cancellation rates or payment issues

### 5. Bulk Operations & Management
- **Bulk Actions**:
  - Export client lists (CSV/Excel)
  - Send bulk messages (email/SMS)
  - Apply tags or status updates
  - Archive inactive clients
- **Smart Lists**: Save filtered views for quick access (VIP clients, new clients, at-risk clients)

### 6. Integration Features
- **Quick Booking**: Book new appointments directly from client profile
- **Revenue Tracking**: Link all financial transactions to client records
- **Provider Notes**: Allow providers to add private notes per client
- **Calendar Integration**: Show client's appointment history in calendar view

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Updates
1. **Create Clients Table**:
   ```typescript
   clients = pgTable("clients", {
     id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
     name: text("name").notNull(),
     email: text("email").unique(),
     phoneNumber: text("phone_number").unique(),
     address: text("address"),
     city: text("city"),
     state: text("state"),
     zipCode: text("zip_code"),
     marketingChannel: text("marketing_channel"),
     acquisitionDate: timestamp("acquisition_date"),
     status: text("status").default("active"), // active, inactive, vip
     tags: text().array(),
     internalNotes: text("internal_notes"),
     communicationPreference: text("communication_preference"), // email, phone, text
     photoUrl: text("photo_url"),
     createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
     updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").defaultNow(),
   });
   ```

2. **Update Appointments Table**: Add foreign key reference to clients table
3. **Create Migration Script**: Migrate existing client data from appointments to clients table

### Phase 2: API Development
1. **Client Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/clients` - List with pagination and filters
   - `GET /api/clients/search` - Advanced search
   - `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get client details with history
   - `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
   - `PATCH /api/clients/:id` - Update client
   - `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Soft delete/archive
   - `GET /api/clients/:id/appointments` - Client's appointment history
   - `GET /api/clients/:id/analytics` - Client metrics

2. **Bulk Operations**:
   - `POST /api/clients/bulk/export` - Export filtered clients
   - `POST /api/clients/bulk/update` - Bulk update operations

### Phase 3: UI Components
1. **Client List Page** (`/clients`):
   - Search bar with real-time suggestions
   - Filter sidebar
   - Results grid/table with sorting
   - Pagination

2. **Client Detail Page** (`/clients/:id`):
   - Profile header with key metrics
   - Tabbed interface (Overview, Appointments, Financial, Notes, Activity)
   - Quick actions sidebar

3. **Client Creation/Edit Modal**:
   - Form with validation
   - Duplicate detection
   - Auto-complete for existing clients

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. **Client Segmentation**: Automatic grouping based on behavior
2. **Retention Alerts**: Notify when regular clients haven't booked recently
3. **Birthday/Anniversary Tracking**: Special date reminders
4. **Referral Tracking**: Track which clients refer others
5. **Client Portal Access**: Future feature for clients to view their own history
