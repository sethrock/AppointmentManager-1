# Google Calendar Integration Audit - Updated Analysis

## Current Status: **AUTHENTICATION FAILURE**

### Primary Issue
**Invalid Refresh Token**: The Google OAuth refresh token is returning "invalid_grant" error
- All environment variables are present and configured
- Calendar integration code is properly implemented
- Authentication layer is failing to obtain valid access tokens

## Environment Variables Status
✅ **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**: Present and valid  
✅ **GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Present and valid  
❌ **GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN**: Present but expired/invalid  
✅ **GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID**: Present  
✅ **GOOGLE_ARCHIVE_CALENDAR_ID**: Present  

## Test Results
```
POST /api/test/calendar
Response: {"success":false,"message":"Failed to connect to Google Calendar API"}
Server Log: "Failed to refresh token: Error: invalid_grant"
```

## Code Architecture Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation
1. **Robust Error Handling**: System gracefully degrades when calendar unavailable
2. **Proper Integration Points**: 
   - New appointments trigger `handleNewAppointmentNotifications()`
   - Status updates trigger `handleAppointmentStatusNotifications()`
3. **Smart Calendar Management**:
   - Active appointments → Main calendar (GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID)
   - Completed/Cancelled → Archive calendar (GOOGLE_ARCHIVE_CALENDAR_ID)
4. **Status-Aware Event Handling**:
   - "Reschedule" → Updates existing event with new datetime
   - "Complete" → Moves to archive with "COMPLETED:" prefix
   - "Cancel" → Moves to archive with "CANCELLED:" prefix

### Technical Implementation Quality
- ✅ Timezone properly set (America/Los_Angeles)
- ✅ Event details include client info, location, financial data
- ✅ Async processing doesn't block API responses  
- ✅ Calendar event IDs stored in database for tracking
- ✅ Attendee management (client email added when available)

### Event Lifecycle (Design)
```
New Appointment → Calendar Event Created → Event ID Stored
    ↓
Status Update → Check Current Calendar → Update or Move Event
    ↓
Reschedule → Update event datetime in same calendar
Complete/Cancel → Move event to archive calendar with status prefix
```

## Root Cause: OAuth Token Expiration

The "invalid_grant" error indicates your Google refresh token has expired. This happens when:
- Token unused for 6+ months
- Google account password changed
- OAuth consent revoked
- Application credentials regenerated

## Solution: Generate New Refresh Token

### Step-by-Step OAuth Playground Process

1. **Prepare Your Credentials**
   - Client ID: [Your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID from secrets]
   - Client Secret: [Your GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET from secrets]

2. **Access OAuth Playground**
   - Go to: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
   - Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right
   - Check "Use your own OAuth credentials"
   - Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Click "Close"

3. **Select Scopes**
   - In "Step 1: Select & authorize APIs"
   - Find "Calendar API v3"
   - Select: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
   - Click "Authorize APIs"

4. **Complete Authorization**
   - Sign in to your Google account
   - Grant permissions to your application
   - You'll be redirected back to OAuth Playground

5. **Exchange for Tokens**
   - In "Step 2: Exchange authorization code for tokens"
   - Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
   - Copy the `refresh_token` value (long string starting with "1//")

6. **Update Your Application**
   - Replace your current GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN with the new value
   - The application will automatically restart

### Verification Steps
After updating the token:
1. Test connection: `POST /api/test/calendar` should return `{"success":true}`
2. Create test appointment to verify event creation
3. Update appointment status to verify calendar updates

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### New Appointment Created
- Email notification sent
- Calendar event created in main calendar
- Event ID stored in database

### Status Changes
- **Reschedule**: Event updated with new date/time in same calendar
- **Complete**: Event moved to archive calendar with "COMPLETED:" prefix  
- **Cancel**: Event moved to archive calendar with "CANCELLED:" prefix

### Calendar Event Details Include
- Client name and contact info
- Appointment type (IN/OUT call)
- Location (office or full address)
- Financial information (deposit, payment method)
- Duration and timing

## Impact Assessment

**Current Impact**: 
- Zero calendar integration functionality
- Manual calendar management required
- No automated appointment tracking in Google Calendar

**Post-Fix Impact**:
- Automatic calendar event creation for all new appointments
- Real-time calendar updates reflecting appointment status changes
- Organized calendar management with active/archive separation
