## Integration Architecture Overview

### How Google Calendar Integration Works

The application implements a **dual-calendar management system**:

1. **Primary Calendar** (`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`): Active appointments (Scheduled, Rescheduled)
   - Calendar ID: `152ceb7add7a4c3d50393eab9d3a6f77ba8cca812d18513dc89955d96eb2d1c1@group.calendar.google.com`
   
2. **Archive Calendar** (`GOOGLE_ARCHIVE_CALENDAR_ID`): Completed and cancelled appointments
   - Calendar ID: `a1e0e208c4073f129c1cd798bd81c7ad8cf8d0cb681a71dabe295012c9bb4b15@group.calendar.google.com`

### Workflow Processing
- **New Appointments**: Created in primary calendar with "SCHEDULED:" prefix
- **Reschedules**: Updated in primary calendar with "RESCHEDULED:" prefix and new dates
- **Completions**: Moved to archive calendar with "COMPLETE:" prefix
- **Cancellations**: Moved to archive calendar with "CANCEL:" prefix

### Event Summary Format
Calendar events use **LARGE CASE** status prefixes for easy identification:
- `SCHEDULED: [Client Name] - [Type]`
- `RESCHEDULED: [Client Name] - moved to [New Date]`
- `COMPLETE: [Client Name] - [Date]`
- `CANCEL: [Client Name] - [Date]`
