ooking at your database schema and revenue service implementation, I can explain how the realized_revenue column is computed.
Based on the code in server/services/revenueService.ts, the realized_revenue field is NOT currently being calculated or updated in your application.
However, from the revlogic.md documentation, I can see the intended business logic:
Intended Logic for Realized Revenue:
	1	Initially: realized_revenue = deposit_amount (when appointment is first created)
	2	When status changes to 'complete', 'scheduled', or 'rescheduled': realized_revenue becomes the same as recognized_revenue (deposit_amount + total_collected)
Current Implementation Gap: The revenueService.ts only calculates recognizedRevenue and deferredRevenue, but doesn't handle realizedRevenue. The database column exists in your schema, but it's not being populated by any business logic.
How it should work:
	•	When an appointment is created: realized_revenue = deposit_amount
	•	When appointment status changes to complete/scheduled/rescheduled: realized_revenue = recognized_revenue
	•	For cancelled appointments: realized_revenue would remain at the original deposit amount
Currently, the realized_revenue values in your database are likely either:
	1	Zero (default value)
	2	Manually entered values
	3	Values from imported data
To implement the proper calculation, the revenue service would need to be updated to include realized revenue logic and integrated into the appointment creation/u

We need to update the intended business logic as follows: 

for step 1 (when the appointment is first created) realized_revenue = deposit_amount and deposit_amount = deferred_revenue. recognized _revenue  = projected_revenue

For step 2:

disposition_status = complete: then realized_revenue = total_collected  + deposit_amount also the (deferred_revenue - deposit_amount) this should make the deferred_revenue value = 0.

disposition_status = reschedule: then nothing is to be changed with respect to the financials. note: when we reschedule an appointment we do not collect another deposit so it’s important that we are not doubling the deposit in the realized_revenue for rescheduled appointments


disposition_status = cancel:  This is where we need to make a change to form that is presented to the user when they select ‘cancel’. We need to have a form field that accepts a number and appears before the Notes with the question of ‘Amount of Deposit to Return’ make the database column ‘deposit_return_amount’. Also, along with this new form field I would like the original value of the database entry ‘deposit_amount’ to be referenced on the form… Something like ‘Original Deposit Amount = ‘deposit_amount’.’

Whatever dollar amount number that is entered into deposit_return_amount is then subtracted from the ‘realized_revenue’. 

To finish the workflow/logic and to ensure we refunded our client create another column in the database next to ‘deposit_return_amount’ and name that column ‘deposit_returned’ with a default of False.

Finally update the e-mail notification for CANCELED APPOINTMENT to include the notice ‘Amount of Deposit to be returned is ‘deposit_return_amount’. Also, create in the e-mail a hypertext link that says… Please ’Click Here’ to Confirm that the client has been refunded. When this ‘Click Here’ hypertext link is clicked it will update the database ‘deposit_returned’ = True
