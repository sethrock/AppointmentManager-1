# Google Calendar Multiple Reschedule Fix Documentation

## Request Summary
The user requested that appointments should be able to be rescheduled multiple times (infinitely) until they reach a disposition status of either 'Complete' or 'Canceled', with each reschedule properly updating the Google Calendar event.

## The Problem
The Google Calendar was only updating on the first reschedule, but subsequent reschedules were not updating the calendar event. The appointment data was updating correctly in the database, but the calendar event remained stuck on the first rescheduled date/time.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the notification service logic (`notificationService.ts`). The `handleAppointmentStatusNotifications` function had a guard clause that would exit early if the disposition status hadn't changed:

```typescript
// Only proceed if the status has changed
if (!appointment.dispositionStatus || appointment.dispositionStatus === previousStatus) {
  return;
}
```

After the first reschedule, the disposition status was set to "Reschedule". When performing subsequent reschedules, the status remained "Reschedule" (previousStatus: "Reschedule" â†’ currentStatus: "Reschedule"), causing the function to return early without processing the calendar update.

## The Solution

### 1. Routes Layer Update (`server/routes.ts`)
Modified the appointment update endpoint to detect not just status changes, but also date/time changes for appointments that are already in "Reschedule" status:

```typescript
const isStatusChange = parsedData.data.dispositionStatus && 
                     parsedData.data.dispositionStatus !== previousStatus;

const isRescheduleUpdate = updatedAppointment.dispositionStatus === 'Reschedule' && 
                          (parsedData.data.updatedStartDate || 
                           parsedData.data.updatedStartTime || 
                           parsedData.data.updatedEndDate || 
                           parsedData.data.updatedEndTime);

if (isStatusChange || isRescheduleUpdate) {
  // Process notifications...
}
```

### 2. Notification Service Update (`server/services/notificationService.ts`)
Updated the notification handler to process reschedule date/time updates even when the status doesn't change:

```typescript
// Check if this is a status change
const isStatusChange = appointment.dispositionStatus && appointment.dispositionStatus !== previousStatus;

// Check if this is a reschedule date/time update (when status is already "Reschedule")
const isRescheduleUpdate = appointment.dispositionStatus === 'Reschedule' && 
                          previousStatus === 'Reschedule' &&
                          (appointment.updatedStartDate || appointment.updatedStartTime);

// Only proceed if status changed OR if it's a reschedule update
if (!isStatusChange && !isRescheduleUpdate) {
  return;
}
```

### 3. Existing Calendar Service Logic
The calendar service (`calendarService.ts`) already had proper logic to:
- Update calendar events with new dates/times
- Search for events in both active and archive calendars
- Handle the scenario where an event might have been moved between calendars

## Testing Results
The fix was tested with the following scenario:
- Client: "Scooter-test-AI"
- Original appointment: June 16, 2025 @ 5:00pm - 7:00pm
- Reschedule 1: June 17, 2025 @ 6:00pm - 8:00pm
- Reschedule 2: June 18, 2025 @ 7:00pm - 9:00pm
- Reschedule 3: June 19, 2025 @ 8:00pm - 10:00pm
- Reschedule 4: June 20, 2025 @ 9:00pm - 11:00pm

All reschedules now properly update the Google Calendar event with the new date and time while maintaining the same calendar event ID.

## Key Improvements
1. **Multiple Reschedules**: Appointments can now be rescheduled an unlimited number of times
2. **Calendar Sync**: Each reschedule properly updates the Google Calendar event
3. **Status Persistence**: The appointment maintains its "Reschedule" status throughout multiple reschedules
4. **Event Consistency**: The same calendar event ID is maintained, preventing duplicate events
5. **Proper Logging**: Added specific logging for reschedule date/time updates vs. status changes

## Technical Notes
- The fix ensures backward compatibility with existing appointments
- No database schema changes were required
- The solution properly handles edge cases like events that might have been manually deleted from Google Calendar
- Email notifications are sent for each reschedule to keep clients informed
