## Integration Architecture Overview

### How Google Calendar Integration Works

The application implements a **dual-calendar management system**:

1. **Primary Calendar** (`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`): Active appointments (Scheduled, Rescheduled)
2. **Archive Calendar** (`GOOGLE_ARCHIVE_CALENDAR_ID`): Completed and cancelled appointments

### Event Lifecycle Management
```
New Appointment → Calendar Event Created → Event ID Stored
    ↓
Status Update → Check Current Calendar → Update or Move Event
    ↓
Reschedule → Update event datetime in same calendar
Complete/Cancel → Move event to archive calendar with STATUS: prefix
```

### Status Display Format
- **Active Appointments**: "Appointment: [Client Name] - [IN/OUT]"
- **Rescheduled**: "RESCHEDULED: [Client Name] - moved to [New Date]"
- **Completed**: "COMPLETED: [Client Name] - [Date]"
- **Cancelled**: "CANCELLED: [Client Name] - [Date]"
