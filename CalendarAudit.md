# Google Calendar Integration Audit

## Current Status: **FAILING**

### Primary Issue
**Authentication Failure**: Google refresh token is invalid/expired
- Error: `invalid_grant` when attempting to refresh OAuth token
- Calendar events are not being created or updated for any appointment status changes

## Environment Variables Status
✅ **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**: Present  
✅ **GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Present  
✅ **GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN**: Present (but expired/invalid)  
✅ **GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID**: Present  
✅ **GOOGLE_ARCHIVE_CALENDAR_ID**: Present  

## Code Analysis

### Integration Points Working Correctly
1. **Notification Service**: Properly configured to check calendar credentials before attempting operations
2. **Route Integration**: Both new appointment creation and status updates correctly trigger notifications
3. **Calendar Service Structure**: Well-implemented with proper error handling and logging
4. **Status-Based Calendar Management**: 
   - Active appointments → Main calendar
   - Completed/Cancelled → Archive calendar
   - Proper event moving between calendars

### Calendar Event Lifecycle (When Working)
1. **New Appointment**: Creates event in main calendar
2. **Status Changes**:
   - `Reschedule` → Updates event with new date/time
   - `Complete` → Moves to archive calendar with "COMPLETED" prefix
   - `Cancel` → Moves to archive calendar with "CANCELLED" prefix

### Technical Implementation Quality
- ✅ Proper timezone handling (America/Los_Angeles)
- ✅ Comprehensive event details (description, location, attendees)
- ✅ Error handling and logging throughout
- ✅ Async processing to avoid blocking API responses
- ✅ Calendar event ID tracking in database

## Root Cause Analysis

The Google OAuth refresh token has expired. This commonly happens when:
1. Token hasn't been used for 6 months (Google's expiration policy)
2. User changed Google account password
3. OAuth consent was revoked
4. Application credentials were regenerated

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix Required
**Generate a new Google refresh token** using these steps:

1. **Google Cloud Console Setup**:
   - Verify OAuth 2.0 client credentials in Google Cloud Console
   - Ensure redirect URI includes `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`

2. **OAuth Playground Process**:
   - Go to https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
   - Click gear icon → "Use your own OAuth credentials"
   - Enter your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - In Step 1: Select "Calendar API v3" → `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
   - Click "Authorize APIs" and complete Google sign-in
   - In Step 2: Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
   - Copy the new `refresh_token` value

3. **Update Environment Variable**:
   - Replace current GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN with the new value

### Testing Process
After updating the refresh token:
1. Test connection: `POST /api/test/calendar`
2. Create a test appointment to verify event creation
3. Update appointment status to verify event updates/moves

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Token Refresh Monitoring**: Add alerts when token refresh fails
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning without calendar integration
3. **Token Rotation**: Implement automatic token refresh handling
4. **Health Check Dashboard**: Include calendar integration status

## Impact Assessment

**Current Impact**: 
- No calendar events being created for new appointments
- No calendar updates when appointment status changes
- Email notifications still working (unaffected)
- Application functionality otherwise normal

**User Experience**: 
- Manual calendar management required
- No automated scheduling integration
- Status changes not reflected in calendar

## Verification Steps Post-Fix
1. Create new appointment → Check calendar event creation
2. Update to "Reschedule" → Verify event update with new datetime
3. Update to "Complete" → Verify move to archive calendar
4. Update to "Cancel" → Verify move to archive calendar with proper labeling
