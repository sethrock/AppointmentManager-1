# Future Earnings Analytics Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding projected future income analytics to the appointment management system. The feature will analyze scheduled appointments to project future earnings across multiple timeframes.

## Feature Requirements

### Time Frames
- **Today**: Appointments scheduled for today
- **1 Week**: Next 7 days from today
- **2 Weeks**: Next 14 days from today  
- **3 Weeks**: Next 21 days from today
- **1 Month**: Next 30 days from today
- **All Future**: All scheduled appointments beyond today

### Key Metrics to Display
1. **Projected Gross Revenue**: Sum of `grossRevenue` for all scheduled appointments
2. **Expected Deposits**: Sum of `depositAmount` for scheduled appointments
3. **Net Projected Income**: Gross revenue minus expected expenses
4. **Appointment Count**: Number of scheduled appointments per timeframe
5. **Average Appointment Value**: Projected revenue per appointment
6. **Provider Breakdown**: Earnings projection by provider
7. **Revenue Confidence**: Based on appointment status and historical completion rates

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Backend API Enhancement
Add new endpoint: `GET /api/analytics/future-earnings`

**Query Parameters:**
- `timeframe`: today|1week|2weeks|3weeks|1month|all
- `provider`: optional filter by specific provider
- `includeRescheduled`: boolean to include appointments with "Reschedule" status

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "timeframe": "1week",
  "summary": {
    "projectedRevenue": 15000,
    "expectedDeposits": 5000,
    "netProjectedIncome": 13500,
    "appointmentCount": 8,
    "averageValue": 1875,
    "confidenceScore": 0.85
  },
  "byProvider": [
    {
      "provider": "Sera",
      "projectedRevenue": 8000,
      "appointmentCount": 4,
      "averageValue": 2000
    }
  ],
  "byDate": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-15",
      "projectedRevenue": 3000,
      "appointmentCount": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Database Query Strategy
Filter appointments by:
- `startDate >= today`
- `dispositionStatus IN ('Scheduled', 'Reschedule', NULL)`
- Date ranges based on timeframe parameter

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### New Analytics Tab: "Future Earnings"
Add to existing analytics page (`client/src/pages/analytics.tsx`):

**Components to Add:**
- `FutureEarningsOverview`: Summary cards for each timeframe
- `EarningsProjectionChart`: Line chart showing projected earnings over time
- `ProviderEarningsBreakdown`: Bar chart by provider
- `EarningsCalendar`: Calendar view with daily projections
- `ConfidenceIndicator`: Visual indicator of projection reliability

#### Key Visualizations:
1. **Timeframe Comparison Cards**: Side-by-side comparison of all timeframes
2. **Earnings Trend Line**: Daily/weekly projection chart
3. **Provider Performance**: Horizontal bar chart
4. **Revenue Mix**: Pie chart showing deposit vs. remaining revenue
5. **Calendar Heatmap**: Visual representation of busy/profitable days

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Confidence Scoring
Calculate confidence based on:
- Historical completion rates by provider
- Time until appointment (closer = higher confidence)
- Appointment status (Scheduled > Reschedule)
- Client history (returning clients = higher confidence)

#### Smart Projections
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Factor in historical patterns
- **Provider Availability**: Account for provider schedules
- **Market Trends**: Consider booking velocity
- **Risk Assessment**: Flag potential cancellation risks

#### Scenario Analysis
- **Conservative**: Lower confidence multiplier
- **Realistic**: Standard projections
- **Optimistic**: Include potential upsells/extensions

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Service: `futureEarningsService.ts`
```typescript
export interface FutureEarningsData {
  timeframe: string;
  summary: EarningsSummary;
  byProvider: ProviderEarnings[];
  byDate: DateEarnings[];
  confidence: ConfidenceMetrics;
}

export interface EarningsSummary {
  projectedRevenue: number;
  expectedDeposits: number;
  netProjectedIncome: number;
  appointmentCount: number;
  averageValue: number;
  confidenceScore: number;
}
```

#### Frontend Hook: `useFutureEarnings`
```typescript
export function useFutureEarnings(timeframe: string, provider?: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['future-earnings', timeframe, provider],
    queryFn: () => fetchFutureEarnings(timeframe, provider)
  });
}
```

### 6. Integration Points

#### Dashboard Integration
Add "Future Earnings" widget to main dashboard showing:
- Next 7 days projected revenue
- Today's scheduled appointments value
- Quick trend indicator

#### Existing Analytics Enhancement
Extend current analytics page with new "Future" tab alongside:
- Overview
- Revenue (historical)
- Performance
- Insights
- **Future** (new)

### 7. Database Optimizations

#### Indexes to Add:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_future_earnings 
ON appointments(start_date, disposition_status) 
WHERE start_date >= CURRENT_DATE;

CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_provider_future 
ON appointments(provider, start_date, disposition_status) 
WHERE start_date >= CURRENT_DATE;
```
